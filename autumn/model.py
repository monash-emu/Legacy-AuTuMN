    The transmission dynamic model to underpin all AuTuMN analyses.

    All TB-specific methods and structures are contained in this model.
    Methods are written to be adaptable to any model structure selected (through the __init__ arguments).
    Time variant parameters that are optional (which mostly consists of optional interventions that will be required in
    some countries and not others) are written as "plug-ins" wherever possible (meaning that the model should still run
